# Telco Customer Churn ‚Äî SQL Analysis

## üìä Project Overview
This SQL project explores a telecom company's customer data to identify churn behavior and uncover key business insights. It focuses on querying raw data using SQL to extract actionable information prior to visualizations and modeling.

## üéØ Objectives
- Analyze customer churn patterns using SQL queries
- Break down churn by contract type, payment method, and demographics
- Understand the behavior of churned vs loyal customers
- Prepare data insights for visualization and business reporting

## ‚ùì Business Questions Answered Using SQL

### üß© General Customer Insights
1. **How many total customers are there?**
2. **How many customers have churned vs stayed?**
3. **What is the overall churn rate (percentage)?**

### üìä Churn by Contract Type and Services
4. **What is the churn rate by contract type (Month-to-month, One year, Two year)?**
5. **Which internet service type has the highest churn?**
6. **What‚Äôs the average monthly charge of churned vs non-churned customers?**
7. **Which payment method has the highest number of churned customers?**

### üë• Demographic Breakdown
8. **Is there a difference in churn between senior citizens and non-senior citizens?**
9. **What‚Äôs the churn count grouped by gender?**
10. **How does having a partner or dependents affect churn?**

### üìà Usage and Tenure Patterns
11. **Do customers with higher MonthlyCharges churn more than those with lower charges?**
12. **What is the average tenure of churned vs loyal customers?**
13. **Group customers into tenure buckets (e.g., 0‚Äì12, 13‚Äì24, etc.). What‚Äôs the churn rate per group?**
14. **What‚Äôs the total revenue from churned customers?**

### üß† Bonus: Risk Profile Logic
15. **Create a churn risk score: Assign 1 if a customer has no partner, no dependents, is on a month-to-month contract, and has no online security. How many customers meet this high-risk churn profile?**
